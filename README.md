# Pappilon

**Map how your commute feels.** Pappilon is a free, public-domain research web app that lets women commuters record how public-transport journeys feel: the stops, streets, platforms and compartments they pass through. Participants add places on a map, look at a picture of each one, and pin what they notice, with a score, tags and a short note. Researchers study these observations across many places to understand what makes them feel safe or unsafe.

> Participation is voluntary and uses informed consent. Pappilon is **not** an emergency service. In an emergency, call 112.

## What it does

Every outing moves through five stages:

1. **Add** places on the map, by tapping it or pressing REPORT where you stand.
2. **Look** at a picture of each place: Street View, a standard Mumbai bus, metro or local-train interior, or your own image.
3. **Pin** what you notice, using icons from three lenses (harassment and unwanted attention, street conditions, human behaviour and social response), with a 1 to 5 score, tags and a note.
4. **Settle** the place with a "gut check" rating of how safe the whole place feels.
5. **Send off** your work as a zip of annotated pictures and CSV lists.

Other features:

- Works on a phone in Chrome and can be installed as an app (PWA), with offline support.
- Optional daily reminders for people who have not recorded that day.
- Informed-consent flow shown once after account creation, stored as a signed record.
- Levels and Insights to encourage participants.
- No real names: sign-in uses a project-issued User ID.

## For participants

1. Open the app link from your project coordinator **in Chrome**.
2. Tap the three-dot menu, then **Install app** (optional).
3. Create an account, read and sign the consent form, then start a session.

Full instructions are in the [wiki](wiki.html) and the [user guide](user-guide.pdf).

## For researchers: setting up your own copy

Pappilon is a static web app (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) backed by [Supabase](https://supabase.com). You can host the files on GitHub Pages or any static host over HTTPS.

### 1. Create a Supabase project

1. Create a free project at supabase.com.
2. In **Authentication**, enable email sign-in and turn off email confirmation. The app creates accounts as `<user-id>@sheloiterlens.app`, a fixed internal domain that is kept for database compatibility.
3. In the **SQL editor**, run the main setup SQL (the app's setup screen shows it), then run `supabase_consent_setup.sql` from this repository. This creates the tables `sll_points`, `sll_annotations`, `sll_reviews` and `sll_consents`, the private storage buckets `exports` and `consents`, and the row-level security policies.

### 2. Point the app at your project

Open `app/index.html` and set your project URL and anon (public) key in the configuration block near the top of the script. The anon key is designed to be public; row-level security protects the data. **Never** put the `service_role` key in the app.

### 3. Publish

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, choose the branch and folder to serve.
3. Open the published address in Chrome on a phone, confirm sign-up, consent and a test recording work, then test **Install app**.

### 4. Collect the data

- Participants export a zip (annotated images, a pins CSV and a points CSV) and share it with you, or you read the records from Supabase.
- Signed consent forms are stored in the private `consents` bucket with a SHA-256 hash and can be downloaded from the Supabase dashboard (**Storage → consents**) or from the `sll_consents` table.

### Local testing

Service workers and installation need `https` or `localhost`, so test with a local server instead of double-clicking the file:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Adding the standard interior images

The app has buttons for standard bus, metro and local-train interiors. Place your images in the folder the app expects and check the file names in `app/index.html`. Images may be 360-degree panoramas or flat images. Make sure you have the right to use and publish any image you add.

## Built with

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) for the map
- [Photo Sphere Viewer](https://photo-sphere-viewer.js.org) for 360-degree and flat pictures
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com) for CSV
- [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) for exports
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for accounts and storage
- Map tiles by CARTO, map data from OpenStreetMap contributors

See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for licences.

## Privacy, ethics and safety

- Taking part is voluntary and participants can stop at any time without consequences.
- Informed consent is collected once, before any data is recorded. The text of the consent form is versioned.
- Participants are asked not to record places within 500 metres of their home or workplace, and not to record names, phone numbers, number plates or faces.
- Data is stored in a private Supabase project under row-level security. Do not make buckets or tables public.
- If you deploy Pappilon for your own study, get approval from your own ethics board and adapt the consent text, contacts and helplines to your context.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

1. Open an issue describing the bug or idea first.
2. Fork the repository, create a branch, and make your change.
3. Keep the app a plain static site with no build step unless discussed.
4. By contributing, you agree to dedicate your contribution to the public domain under CC0 1.0, the same as the project.

Please do not post real participant data, screenshots with identifying details, keys or passwords in issues.
